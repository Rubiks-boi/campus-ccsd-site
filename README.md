# campus-ccsd-site
This project is the source code for my senior capstone project.

I am researching ethical hacking, and as a part of that, I am becoming an ethical hacker, seeing how likely people are to send their information.

My project targets Infinite Campus (campus.ccsd.net) by copying the layout but logging information when the user signs in. I can log information such as the timestamp, the username, the email associated with the user, etc. (I am not directly logging the password because the purpose of this project is not malicious; I am merely seeing whether people fall for the phishing attempt or not.)

I will send a link to campusccsd.com from a fake email posing as Infinite Campus support, and from there log information on who opened the email, who opened the site, and who actually typed in their information.
